    <h1>Travel
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love traveling, no matter going by myself or with friends. Whenever I am on a break, I would
        take the opportunity to go on a trip. It could be as short as 1 - 2 days, or as long as 1 - 2
        weeks. Here are some of the places or transits that I have been to during my trips, including
        Vietnam, Phillipines, Japan, UAE, Qatar, and of course, the USA.

    <h1>Food
    </h1>
    <p>
        I also want to eat good food, especially the healthy and tasty ones. I enjoy Asian cuisines the most, 
        not because I am most familiar with them, but because Asians regard food and family meals as a necessity
        in their daily lives. As a result, they pay close attention to the nutrients, appearance, and taste of their food.
