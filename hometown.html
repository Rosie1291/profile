    <h1>My country: Vietnam
    </h1>
    <img src="images/hanoi.png" alt="Hanoi" class = "right" width="22%" height="auto"> 
    <p>It is a small country in the Southeast Asia region with total area of only 128,070 sq mi, ranking 66th in world territories.
        Despite being a relatively small country, Vietnam's population is nearly 100 million people, which makes itself the 15th most
        populous country in the world. As a tropical country with a coastline of 2,140 miles (nearly as much as its land boundaries),
        Vietnam takes pride in its agriculture. It is also becoming more popular as a tourist destination thanks to amazing sceneries,
        friendly people, tasty cuisines and most importantly, affordable prices. </p>

    <h1>My city: Hanoi
    </h1>
    <p>Hanoi is the capital city of Vietnam, also known as the political centre of the country. Its population is approximately 9 million people,
        with a growing trend in urbanization. However, to most Vietnamese people, including myself, Hanoi reamains a symbol of power and ancient beauty,
        a blend of both classic and modern in its cultures, infrastructures, people, and more. I adore the city where I have spent my entire life, 
        a place that has preserved a history dating back over 1000 years while remaining vibrant with diversity and bustling lifestyles. </p>
