                <h2>My background</h2>
                <p>I grew up in Hanoi, Vietnam. My family owns a business and I have ever been inspired
                    to become an entrepreneur like my parents. I have two much elder sisters, which made
                    me the aunt of two little babies.</p>
                <p>My family has always stressed the importance of education on their children, and I consider
                    myself a living proof of their Asian heritage. Nevertheless, my parents always respect their kids'
                    decisions and are quite open-minded. </p>
                <h2>My education</h2>
                <p>I have grown up in such a disciplined yet supportive environment, which helps me strive for success and never 
                    has the opportunity to blame my procrastination on my strict parents (sadly). Currently, I am a senior majoring in 
                    Computer Science at Caldwell University. I have always been interested in business and social matters. 
                    However, after learning math and programming languages for a while, I feel like I have so much to learn from and contribute 
                    to the growing technology of the 2st century. Therefore, I have decided to choose my current major in order to grow my tech 
                    skills set, and also to prove to my Asian relatives that a girl can code :)
                </p>
                <h2>Future plan</h2>
                <p>I have just started with my major in Computer Science and there is so much more to explore. At the moment, I am quite interested in
                    web development. After graduation, I want to work as a frontend software engineer, and later on a full-stack engineer, which may not come
                    into reality in years.
                </p>
                <p>I am also passionate about providing high-quality STEM education to young children, particularly those in underdeveloped and developing countries. 
                    If I have the opportunity, I would like to use my degree in computer science to do such meaningful things later in life.
